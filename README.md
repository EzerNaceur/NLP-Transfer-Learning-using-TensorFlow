# TensorFlow NLP Transfer Learning Project 🚀

## Overview ℹ️

This project utilizes pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub to perform transfer learning on real-world text data. By fine-tuning these models on specific tasks or domains, we aim to enhance their performance and adapt them to our particular use case.

## Features ✨

- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained NLP text embedding models for transfer learning.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the pre-trained models on real-world text data to improve performance.
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Visualizing model performance metrics using TensorBoard for better understanding and analysis.

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python >= 3.6
- TensorFlow >= 2.0
- TensorFlow Hub
- TensorBoard

## Installation 💻

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone [https://github.com/N00ber17/NLP-Transfer-Learning-using-Tensorflow.git](https://github.com/N00ber17/NLP-Transfer-Learning-using-TensorFlow)
cd your_project
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
## Usage 📝

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your text data for fine-tuning. This may include cleaning, preprocessing, and splitting into training/validation/test sets.

2. **Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained NLP text embedding model from TensorFlow Hub that best suits your task. Import the model and prepare it for transfer learning.

3. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune the selected model on your real-world text data. Customize the training process based on your specific requirements and performance goals.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on validation and test datasets. Monitor metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Visualization with TensorBoard**: Integrate TensorBoard into your project to visualize training and evaluation metrics. Use TensorBoard to analyze model performance, identify potential issues, and track training progress.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the fine-tuned model for inference in your application or system. Ensure compatibility and optimize performance for your deployment environment.
